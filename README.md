# Eigen-Value algorithm
This Repository consists of implementation of Principal Component Analysis(PCA) of an N X N image input which is find using the Jacobi Eigenvalue Algorithm in matlab and verilog. Using the co-variance matrix `C = A*(A)^T` of an image A and applying similiar transformation on `C` and then finding eigenvectors based on that. Mean Square error is also plotted against inbuilt function.

For the FPGA implementation,
